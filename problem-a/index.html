        <a href="https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Tyler_Durden">Tyler Durden</a> is a
        fictional character and the main antagonist and anti hero of the 1996 Chuck Palahniuk novel <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fight_Club">Fight Club</a> and in its 1999
        cult film adaptation of the same name. He is portrayed by the actor Brad Pitt, Who also played in movies such as
        Inglorious Basterds and 12 Monkeys. Now, what makes Tyler such an iconic villain? Is the fact that he represents
        ademption of masculinity repackaged as the promise of violence in the interests of social and political anarchy.

    <ul>
        <li>He's strong and independent</li>
        <li>He opposes the mundane, consumerist ideals of society and fights for a different way of existence</li>
        <li class="color">He's hot!</li>
        <li>He represents the ultimate fantasy of every ordinary Joe</li>
        <li>He's a confident leader!!!</li>
    </ul>
